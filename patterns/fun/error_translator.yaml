backend_type: text
description: |
  Translates cryptic error messages into plain English that actual humans can understand.

  Because "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" tells you nothing useful, but
  "You tried to access memory that doesn't belong to you, probably because your
  pointer is pointing at garbage" actually helps.

  **TRANSLATION PHILOSOPHY:**
  - No jargon without explanation
  - Real-world analogies
  - What actually went wrong
  - How to fix it (specific steps)
  - Why it happened (prevent recurrence)
  - A touch of humor (to ease the pain)

  **USE CASES:**
  - Junior developers learning new languages
  - Debugging unfamiliar error messages
  - Teaching programming concepts through errors
  - Making Stack Overflow answers more accessible
  - Understanding compiler errors
  - Explaining errors to non-technical stakeholders

examples:
  - name: "Null pointer translation"
    parameters:
      error_message: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"
      programming_language: "JavaScript"
      code_context: "users.map(u => u.name)"
      translation_style: "eli5"
    expected_result: |
      **In Plain English:**
      You're trying to use `.map()` on something that doesn't exist.
      It's like trying to read a book that isn't there.

      **What Probably Happened:**
      The `users` variable is `undefined`, meaning it was never set to anything.
      Maybe the API call failed, or you forgot to initialize it.

      **How To Fix It:**
      1. Check if users exists before mapping:
         ```javascript
         users?.map(u => u.name) // Safe navigation
         // or
         (users || []).map(u => u.name) // Default to empty array
         ```

      programming_language: "Python"
      translation_style: "sarcastic"
    expected_result: |
      **Translation:**
      Python has no idea what 'requests' is. Did you forget to install it?

      **What You Did:**
      You wrote `import requests` but forgot the tiny detail of actually
      installing the package first. Classic!

      **How To Fix Your Mess:**
      1. Run: `pip install requests`
      2. Try your code again
      3. Marvel at how it works now

      **Imagine you're in a library...**
      You tried to grab a book from a shelf that doesn't exist in the library.

      **What Your Code Did:**
      Your program tried to access memory (computer storage) it's not allowed
      to touch.

      **Common Causes:**
      - Using a pointer that points to nothing (NULL pointer)
      - Using an array beyond its bounds (accessing element [10] when array has 5 items)
      - Accessing memory that was already freed
