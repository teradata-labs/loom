  ## Summarization Best Practices

  1. **Choose Right Type**:
     - Extractive: Legal, compliance (exact wording matters)
     - Abstractive: General content (readability matters)
     - Hierarchical: Executives (multiple detail levels)

  2. **Length Guidelines**:
     - Executive: 50-100 words
     - Standard: 100-200 words
     - Detailed: 200-500 words

  3. **Preserve Critical Info**: Names, dates, numbers, decisions
  4. **Multiple Summaries**: For very long docs (10K+ words), summarize sections first
  5. **Bullet Points**: More scannable than paragraphs
