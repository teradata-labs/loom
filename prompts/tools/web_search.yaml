      Search the web for current information, news, articles, and documentation.
      Returns search results with titles, URLs, snippets, and optional content.
      AI-optimized search results using Tavily by default!

      Supports multiple providers:
      - Tavily (default, AI-optimized results, FREE API key, 1000/month)
      - Brave Search (excellent results, FREE API key, 2000/month)
      - SerpAPI (Google results, requires API key, 100/month free)
      - DuckDuckGo (no API key required, instant answers only, limited results)

      Use this tool to:
      - Find current information beyond training data cutoff
      - Research recent news and events (e.g., "latest Go 1.23 features 2025")
      - Look up documentation and guides
      - Verify facts and claims with sources
      - Find authoritative sources for citations
      - Check current prices, availability, or status
      - Research technical topics with latest updates

      When to use web search:
      - User asks about recent events or current information
      - Need to verify claims with external sources
      - Looking for documentation or guides published recently
      - Checking current status of projects, services, or APIs
      - Finding examples or code snippets from the community

      Best practices:
      - Use specific, targeted queries (not broad topics)
      - Include year in query when looking for recent info (e.g., "Go concurrency 2025")
      - Check multiple results before drawing conclusions
      - Cite sources with URLs in your response
      - Tavily provides AI-optimized results by default (requires API key)
      - For alternative providers, configure Brave or use DuckDuckGo (no key needed)

      Getting better results:
      To use Tavily or other premium providers, configure API keys via:
        1. CLI (recommended): looms config set-key tavily_api_key
        2. Environment: Set TAVILY_API_KEY, BRAVE_API_KEY, or SERPAPI_KEY
        3. Direct parameter: api_key="your-key" in tool call

      The tool will automatically use configured keys when you specify the provider.

      Safety:
      - Results are filtered by safe search settings
      - Tavily, Brave, and SerpAPI require API keys for access
      - DuckDuckGo works without API key (limited to instant answers)
      - Rate limits apply based on provider
