      Execute shell commands to interact with the filesystem, run programs, and perform system operations.
      Provides full access to the command line with streaming output and error handling.

      Use this tool to:
      - Run CLI commands (ls, grep, find, cat, etc.)
      - Execute scripts and programs
      - Interact with git, npm, docker, and other tools
      - Process files with standard Unix utilities
      - Chain commands with pipes and redirects

      Features:
      - Streaming output (see results as they arrive)
      - Separate stdout and stderr capture
      - Exit code reporting
      - Working directory persistence across commands
      - Environment variable support

      Best practices:
      - Use absolute paths when possible
      - Quote paths with spaces (e.g., "path with spaces/file.txt")
      - Check exit codes before assuming success
      - Use && to chain dependent commands
      - Use ; to run commands sequentially regardless of errors

      Common patterns:
      - File operations: cat file.txt, echo "content" > file.txt
      - Git operations: git status, git add ., git commit -m "message"
      - Docker: docker ps, docker logs container_id
      - Process management: ps aux | grep process, kill -9 PID
      - File search: find . -name "*.go" -type f

      Safety:
      - Commands run with your user permissions
      - No sudo/elevation by default
      - Sensitive paths (like /etc) may be restricted
      - Long-running commands may timeout

      Examples:
      - List files: shell_execute(command="ls -la")
      - Git status: shell_execute(command="git status")
      - Read file: shell_execute(command="cat README.md")
      - Chain commands: shell_execute(command="cd src && go test ./...")
