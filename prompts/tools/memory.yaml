      Retrieve older conversation history from long-term storage when you need context from earlier in this conversation. Use this when the user references something from a previous discussion that is no longer in recent context.

  - id: clear_recalled_context_description
    content: |
      Remove previously recalled conversation history from context to free up token budget. Use this when you no longer need the older context that was loaded with recall_conversation.

  - id: search_conversation_description
    content: |
      Search conversation history using natural language queries.

      Use this when you need to find relevant context from earlier in the conversation, but don't know the exact offset.

      Examples:
      - "What did we discuss about database optimization?"
      - "Find mentions of API errors"
      - "Search for decisions about authentication"

      The tool uses semantic search to find messages that are conceptually relevant, even if they use different terminology.
