      Access conversation history from long-term storage.

      Three actions available:
      1. recall - Retrieve specific messages by offset/limit from current session
      2. search - Search for relevant messages using natural language queries (supports session scopes)
      3. clear - Remove recalled messages from context to free token budget

      Use this when:
      - User references earlier discussions no longer in recent context
      - Need to find specific topics across conversation history
      - Token budget is tight and old context needs clearing

      Examples:

      Recall old messages:
        conversation_memory(action="recall", offset=0, limit=10)

      Search current session:
        conversation_memory(action="search", query="SQL performance", session_scope="current")

      Search all agent sessions:
        conversation_memory(action="search", query="database optimization", session_scope="agent", limit=5)

      Clear recalled context:
        conversation_memory(action="clear")

      Session scopes:
      - "current" (default): Search only this conversation session
      - "agent": Search all sessions for this agent
      - "all": Search across all sessions (requires permissions)

      The search action uses BM25 + LLM semantic reranking to find conceptually relevant messages, even with different terminology.
