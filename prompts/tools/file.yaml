      ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Use workspace tool instead (session-scoped, indexed, searchable) or shell_execute (cat command).

      Reads content from files on the local filesystem.
      Use this tool to ground your responses in actual data rather than guessing.

      Use this tool to:
      - Read data files saved by previous workflow stages
      - Verify file contents before summarizing
      - Load configuration or results files
      - Read markdown, JSON, XML, or other text files

      Safety: Won't read sensitive system files. Max file size: 10MB.

      RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES:
      - workspace tool: action=read, scope=artifact (session-scoped, indexed, searchable)
      - shell_execute: cat /path/to/file (direct filesystem access)

      ⚠️ DEPRECATED: Use workspace tool instead (session-scoped, indexed, searchable) or shell_execute (echo command).

      Writes content to files on the local filesystem. Creates parent directories automatically.
      Safe by default - won't overwrite system files.

      Use this tool to:
      - Save API responses to files
      - Create data files from agent operations
      - Store results for later processing
      - Generate output files

      RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES:
      - workspace tool: action=write, scope=artifact (session-scoped, indexed, searchable)
      - shell_execute: echo "content" > /path/to/file (direct filesystem access)
