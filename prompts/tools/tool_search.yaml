      Search for available tools using natural language queries. Discover tools from builtin,
      MCP servers, and custom implementations using full-text search with semantic ranking.

      Use this tool to:
      - Find tools for specific tasks ("tools for database queries")
      - Discover available capabilities ("what tools can read files?")
      - Search by keywords ("search tools", "HTTP request tools")
      - Filter by source (builtin, MCP server, custom)
      - Get detailed tool information before using

      Search modes:
      - FAST: Keyword matching with FTS5 (quick, basic relevance)
      - BALANCED: FTS5 + LLM re-ranking (default, good accuracy)
      - ACCURATE: Query expansion + FTS5 + LLM re-ranking (best results, slower)

      Features:
      - FTS5 full-text search with BM25 ranking
      - Semantic understanding with LLM re-ranking
      - Source filtering (builtin, MCP, custom)
      - Capability-based search
      - Confidence scores for results

      Best practices:
      - Use specific queries ("HTTP POST with auth" vs "API")
      - Try BALANCED mode first (good speed/accuracy tradeoff)
      - Check multiple results (top 5-10)
      - Use source filter when you know the tool type
      - Review tool descriptions before using

      When to use tool_search:
      - User asks "What tools are available?"
      - You need a capability but don't know which tool has it
      - You want to verify a tool exists before attempting to use it
      - You're exploring available integrations (MCP servers)
      - You need to recommend tools to the user

      Examples:
      - Find HTTP tools: tool_search(query="make HTTP requests", mode="BALANCED")
      - Search files: tool_search(query="file search grep", mode="FAST")
      - Filter MCP: tool_search(query="database", source="mcp", mode="BALANCED")
      - Find exact tool: tool_search(query="workspace read write", mode="ACCURATE")

      Result format:
      - tool_name: Name of the tool
      - description: What the tool does
      - source: builtin, mcp, or custom
      - confidence: Relevance score (0.0-1.0)
      - capabilities: What the tool can do

      Notes:
      - Results are ranked by relevance
      - LLM re-ranking improves semantic matching
      - Use FAST mode for simple keyword searches
      - Use ACCURATE mode when precision matters
