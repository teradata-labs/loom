      Contacts a human for approval, input, or decision-making. Use this tool when:
      - You need human approval for a high-stakes action (e.g., deleting data, making purchases)
      - You encounter ambiguity that requires human judgment
      - You need human input to proceed (e.g., "Which option should I choose?")
      - You want a human to review your work before proceeding

      This tool blocks execution until the human responds or the request times out.
