      Analyze images using computer vision to extract information, detect objects, read text,
      and understand visual content. Supports multiple vision providers (OpenAI, Anthropic).

      Use this tool to:
      - Extract text from images (OCR)
      - Identify objects and scenes
      - Read charts, graphs, and diagrams
      - Analyze screenshots and UI elements
      - Describe visual content
      - Detect patterns and anomalies

      Supported image formats:
      - PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
      - Base64-encoded images
      - URLs to publicly accessible images
      - Local file paths

      Features:
      - Multi-provider support (OpenAI GPT-4V, Anthropic Claude Vision)
      - Text extraction (OCR) from images
      - Object detection and scene understanding
      - Chart and diagram interpretation
      - Screenshot analysis
      - Structured output (JSON) support

      Best practices:
      - Use high-resolution images for better accuracy
      - Crop images to focus on relevant areas
      - Specify what you're looking for (e.g., "extract table data")
      - Use structured prompts for consistent results
      - Try different providers if results aren't satisfactory

      Common use cases:
      - Document digitization: Extract text from scanned documents
      - Chart analysis: Read data from graphs and visualizations
      - Screenshot debugging: Analyze error messages from screenshots
      - UI testing: Verify visual elements in applications
      - Image cataloging: Generate descriptions for image libraries
      - Quality control: Detect defects in product images

      Examples:
      - OCR: analyze_image(image_path="receipt.jpg", prompt="Extract all text and amounts")
      - Chart: analyze_image(image_url="https://...", prompt="Describe the data trends in this chart")
      - Screenshot: analyze_image(image_path="error.png", prompt="What error is shown?")
      - Object detection: analyze_image(image_path="photo.jpg", prompt="List all objects in this image")

      Result format:
      - analysis: Text description of the image
      - extracted_data: Structured data (if requested)
      - confidence: Provider-specific confidence scores
      - provider: Which vision model was used

      Notes:
      - Requires vision-capable LLM provider (OpenAI GPT-4V, Claude 3+)
      - Large images may be resized automatically
      - Processing time varies by image size and complexity
      - Some providers have rate limits for vision requests
