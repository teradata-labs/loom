# General Purpose Agent with Balanced Compression Profile
#
# This configuration uses the balanced profile, which provides reasonable defaults
# for most use cases. It's a good starting point for new agents before profiling
# your specific workload pattern.
#
# Use cases:
# - Multi-purpose agents with mixed workloads
# - Unknown/variable workload patterns
# - Development and prototyping
# - Default configuration (backwards compatible)

  # No LLM specification - inherits from server defaults

  memory:
    type: sqlite
    max_history: 1000


# Note: If you omit memory_compression entirely, the balanced profile is used automatically:
#
# memory:
#   type: memory
#
# Is equivalent to:
#
# memory:
#   type: memory
#   memory_compression:
#     workload_profile: balanced

# Example Hawk Metrics for Balanced Profile:
# memory.compression.events{profile="balanced",batch_size="normal"} ~8/conversation
# memory.compression.tokens_saved{profile="balanced"} ~40-60% per compression
# memory.compression.budget_pct{profile="balanced"} 60-75% at compression time
