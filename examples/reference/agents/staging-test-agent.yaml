# Staging Test Agent - Phase 2 Validation
#
# This agent is configured to quickly test compression behavior with:
# - data_intensive profile (aggressive compression)
# - Smaller context budget (triggers compression faster)
# - SQLite persistence (for session testing)
#
# Use this for staging validation of Phase 2 adaptive compression.

  # No LLM specification - inherits from server defaults

# Expected Hawk Metrics:
# - memory.profile_configured event with profile="data_intensive"
# - memory.compression.events should trigger every 3-5 turns
# - memory.compression.budget_pct should show 50-70% at compression
# - memory.compression.tokens_saved should show 50-70% savings
# - memory.l1.size should stay <= 5
