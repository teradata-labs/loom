# Chat Agent with Conversational Compression Profile
#
# This configuration is optimized for chatbots and Q&A assistants that require
# larger recent context windows to maintain conversational coherence.
# The conversational profile preserves more messages in L1 and compresses later.
#
# Use cases:
# - Customer support chatbots
# - Educational tutoring agents
# - General-purpose Q&A assistants
# - Multi-turn dialogue systems
